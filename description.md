## How to build the code

This App's code is built using [Gradle](http://gradle.org), for its installation please refer to the [Gradle installation guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html). To then build the code follow the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race
cd lab1-git-race
./gradlew build
```

After the build is completed, the generated WAR file will be located inside the _libs_ folder under the _build_ directory.

## How to test the code

Gradle can perform all tests automatically.

```bash
./gradlew check
```

## How to run the code

This program runs an application server (embedded into Spring library).
In order to build and execute the project you have to do:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Which are the technologies used in the code

* Spring ~ Controller side
* HTML/CSS ~ View side
* Tomcat ~ Server side
* Java ~ Controller engine

This project's code is documented following Javadoc standards.

## Which is the purpose of a specific java annotation

### @SpringBootApplication

This annotation is used on top of most Spring Boot main class programs, as it enables the developer an to configure and scan for components automatically.

This annotation has teh same function as @ComponentScan, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @Configuration with their default attributes, allowing the developer to reduce this three annotations into only one.

Here's a brief description of each annotation's function:

* @Configuration: allows us define the class which possesses it as a configuration class. It also allows us to inject additional dependencies(beans).
* @EnableAutoConfiguration: it's Spring Boot's automatic configuration, which changes in function of the beans aggregated.
* @ComponentScan: works alongside @Configuration in order to tell Spring where to find other @Component, always on the package where the application is located.

If the developer wants to replace one of these three annotations for a different one, it would be necessary to substitute the unwanted annotation.
